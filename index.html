            In this lovely webpage you will learn some facts about me you wish
            you never knew. I was born and raised on a small island called
            Tjörn, beautiful in summer but in winter there is nothing much to
            do, except take day trips to other places. Growing up I was very
            good at soccer so there for I am studying New Media Design.<br />
            My favorit hobbies to do on my spare time is playing soccer, and go
            to aka with NMD. I would say that is the perfect mix of benefit and
            pleasure, nytta och nöje in swedish. Hope you enjoyed the web page,
            and for those of you who want more, I've got you:
