            Cece cosmetics was founded in 2020 by two cousins Maya and Noa.
            Since they were little kids they have always been interested in
            skincare and make-up. As they got older the interest grew and they
            both wanted to make a living by doing what they loved. Maya started
            studying to become a make-up artist and Noa a skin therapist. During
            this time they started to discuss the market and how it was lacking
            good high-end products that were 100% eco-friendly and at the same
            time cruelty-free and vegan. This was the time when their thoughts
            of starting their own cosmetics brand started to bloom. The
            conversations about it got more and more serious, but they did not
            get the support from their family as they were hoping for, except
            from their Grand- mother Cecilia. Cecilia has always supported them
            in everything they have done through life, and has always said to
            them to follow their dreams. She is one of the reasons Maya and Noa
            ventured to quit their jobs and become independent. Picking the name
            was therefore easy, Cece has always been there. Wanna know more? see
